<investigation><title>Sales on Commission</title>

<p>Delbert is offered a part-time job selling restaurant equipment.  He will be paid  $1000  per month plus a 6% commission on his sales.  The sales manager tells Delbert he can expect to sell about $8000 worth of equipment per month.  To help him decide whether to accept the job, Delbert does a few calculations. <ol marker="1">

<li><p>Based on the sales manager's estimate, what monthly income can Delbert expect from this job?  What annual salary would that provide?</p></li>

<li><p>What would Delbert's monthly salary be if he sold only $5000 of equipment per month? What would his salary be if he sold $10,000 worth per month? Compute the monthly incomes for each sales totals shown in the table.</p>

    <p>A <term>mathematical model</term><idx>mathematical model</idx><idx>model</idx> is a simplified description of reality that uses mathematics to help us understand a system or process.</p></assemblage>

<p>We can use a model to analyze data, identify trends, and predict the effects of change. The first step in creating a model is to describe relationships between the variables involved.</p>

<p>Starting from a description in words, we can represent the relationship by:
    <ul><li><p>a table of values</p></li>
        <li><p>a graph, or by</p></li>
        <li><p>an algebraic equation</p></li></ul></p>

<p>Each of these mathematical tools is useful in a different way.

<p>In the examples that follow, observe the interplay among the three modeling tools and how each contributes to the model.</p>

<example xml:id="example-bicycle"><statement><p>In May 2005, the city of Lyons, France, started a bicycle rental program. Over 3,000 bicycles are available at 350 computerized stations around the city. Each of the 52,000 subscribers pays an annual 5 euro fee (about $7.20) and gets a PIN to access the bicycles. The bicycles rent for 1 euro per hour and can be returned to any station.</p>
<p>Your community decides to set up a similar program, charging a $5 subscription fee and $3 an hour for rental. (A fraction of an hour is charged as the corresponding fraction of $3).</p>
        <p><ol marker="a">
            <li><p>Make a table of values showing the cost, <m>C</m>, of renting a bike for various lengths of time, <m>t</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Plot the points on a graph. Draw a curve through the data points.</p></li>
            <li><p>Write an equation for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>t</m>.</p></li></ol></p></statement>
    
<solution><p><ol marker="a">
<li><p>There is an initial fee of $5, and a rental fee of $3 per hour. To find the cost, we multiply the time by $3 per hour, and add the result to the $5 subscription fee.  For example, the cost of a one-hour bike ride is
