<title>Direct Variation</title>

<introduction><p>Two types of functions are widely used in modeling and are known by special names: <term>direct variation</term> and <term>inverse variation</term>.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>Direct Variation</title><idx>directvariation</idx>

<p>Two variables are <term>directly proportional</term><idx>directly proportional</idx> (or just <term>proportional</term><idx>proportional</idx>) if the ratios of their corresponding values are always equal. Consider the functions described in the tables below. The first table shows the price of gasoline as a function of the number of gallons purchased.</p>

<p>The ratio <m>\dfrac{\text{total price}}{\text{number of gallons}}</m>, or price per gallon, is the same for each pair of values in the first table. This agrees with everyday experience: The price per gallon of gasoline is the same no matter how many gallons you buy. Thus, the total price of a gasoline purchase is directly proportional to the number of gallons purchased.</p>

<p>The second table shows the population of a small town as a function of the town’s age. The ratio <m>\dfrac{\text{number of people}}{\text{number of years}}</m> gives the average rate of growth of the population in people per year. You can see that this ratio is <em>not</em> constant; in fact, it increases as time goes on. Thus, the population of the town is <em>not</em> proportional to its age.</p>

<p>The graphs of these two functions are shown below.</p>

<sidebyside width="80%"><image source="images/fig-gasoline-and-population-graphs"  ><description>graphs of gas price and population growth</description></image></sidebyside>

 <p>We see that the price, <m>P</m>, of a fill-up is a linear function of the number of gallons, <m>g</m>, purchased. This should not be surprising if we write an equation relating the variables <m>g</m> and <m>P</m>. Because the ratio of their values is constant, we can write
    <me>\frac{P}{g}= k</me>
where <m>k</m> is a constant. In this example, the constant <m>k</m> is <m>2.40</m>, the price of gasoline per gallon. Solving for <m>P</m> in terms of <m>g</m>, we have
    <me>P = kg = 2.40g</me>
which we recognize as the equation of a line through the origin.</p>

<p>In general, we make the following definition.</p>

<assemblage><title>Direct Variation</title><idx>direct variation</idx>
<p><m>y</m> varies directly with <m>x</m> if
    <me>y = kx</me>
    where <m>k</m> is a positive constant called the <term>constant of variation</term><idx>constant of variation</idx>.
</p></assemblage>

<p>If <m>y</m> varies directly with <m>x</m>, we may also say that <m>y</m> is directly proportional to <m>x</m>.  The two phrases mean the same thing.</p>

<example xml:id="example-circumference-and-simple-interest"><statement><p><ol label="a">
    <li>The circumference, <m>C</m>, of a circle varies directly with its radius, <m>r</m>, because 
        <me>C = 2\pi r </me>
    The constant of variation is <m>2\pi</m>, or about 6.28.</li>
    <li>The amount of interest, <m>I</m>, earned in one year on an account paying 7% simple interest, varies directly with the principal, <m>P</m>, invested, because 
        <me>I = 0.07P</me></li>
    </ol></p></statement></example>

<p>Direct variation defines a linear function of the form
    <me>y = f (x) = kx</me>
The positive constant <m>k</m> in the equation <m>y = kx</m> is just the slope of the graph, so it tells us how rapidly the graph increases. Compared to the standard form for a linear function, <m>y = b + mx</m>, the constant term, <m>b</m>, is zero, so the graph of a direct variation passes through the origin.</p>

<subsection><title>The Scaling Property of Direct Variation</title>

<p>Because the graph of <m>y=kx</m> passes through the origin, direct variation has the following <term>scaling</term> property: if we double the value of <m>x</m>, then the value of <m>y</m> will double also. In fact, increasing <m>x</m> by any factor causes <m>y</m> to increase by the same factor.  Look again at the table for the price of buying gasoline.  Doubling the number of gallons of gas purchased, say, from <m>4</m> gallons to <m>8</m> gallons or from <m>6</m> gallons to <m>12</m> gallons, causes the total price to double also. </p>

    <me>I=0.07(800)= <fillin characters="6"/></me>          
If you increase the investment by a factor of, say, 1.6 to 1.6(800) or $1280, the interest will be 
    <me>I=0.07(1280)= <fillin characters="6"/></me>          
The original interest is increased by a factor of <fillin characters="6"/>.</p></statement></exercise>

<example xml:id="example-two-linear-functions"><statement><p><ol label="a">
    <li>Tuition at Woodrow University is $400 plus $30 per unit. Is the tuition proportional to the number of units you take?</li>
    <li>Imogen makes a 15% commission on her sales of environmentally friendly products marketed by her co-op. Do her earnings vary directly with her sales?</li>
</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>Let <m>u</m> represent the number of units you take, and let <m>T(u)</m> represent your tuition. Then
       <me>T(u) = 400 + 30u</me>
    Thus, <m>T(u)</m> is a linear function of <m>u</m>, but the <m>T</m>-intercept is <m>400</m>, not <m>0</m>. Your tuition is <em>not</em> proportional to the number of units you take, so this is not an example of direct variation. You can check that doubling the number of units does not double the tuition. For example,
       <me>T(6) = 400 + 30(6) = 580</me>
    and
       <me>T(12) = 400 + 30(12) = 760</me>
    Tuition for <m>12</m> units is not double the tuition for <m>6</m> units. The graph of <m>T(u)</m> in figure (a) does not pass through the origin.</p>

    Thus, <m>C(S)</m> is a linear function of <m>S</m> with a <m>C</m>-intercept of zero, so Imogen's earnings do vary directly with her sales. </p></li>

<subsection><title>Finding a Formula for Direct Variation</title>

<p>If we know any one pair of values for the variables in a direct variation, we can find the constant of variation. Then we can use the constant to write a formula for one of the variables as a function of the other.</p>

<example xml:id="example-falling-into-grand-canyon"><statement><p>If you kick a rock off the rim of the Grand Canyon, its speed, <m>v</m>, varies directly with the time, <m>t</m>, it has been falling. The rock is falling at a speed of 39.2 meters per second when it passes a lizard on a ledge 4 seconds later.<ol label="a">
    <li>Express <m>v</m> as a function of <m>t</m>.</li>
    <li>What is the speed of the rock after it has fallen for 6 seconds?</li>
    <li>Sketch a graph of <m>v(t)</m> versus <m>t</m>.</li>
</ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>Because <m>v</m> varies directly with <m>t</m>, there is a positive constant <m>k</m> for which 
            <me>v = kt</me>.
        We substitute <m>v = \alert{39.2}</m> and <m>t = \alert{4}</m> and solve for <m>k</m> to find
            <md><mrow>39.2 \amp = k(4)\amp\amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 4.}}</mrow>
                <mrow>k \amp = 9.8</mrow></md>
    Replacing <m>k</m> by <m>9.8</m>, we find the formula <m>v (t) = 9.8 t</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>We evaluate the function found in part (a) for <m>t = 6</m>.
        <me>v = 9.8(\alert{6}) = 58.8</me>
        At <m>t = 6</m> seconds, the rock is falling at a speed of 58.8 meters per second.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can use your calculator to graph the function <m>v = 9.8t</m>. The graph is shown below.</p>

<p>In any example of direct variation, as the input variable increases through positive values, the output variable increases also. Thus, a direct variation is an increasing function, as we can see when we consider the graphs of some typical direct variations shown below.</p>
<sidebyside width="80%"><image source="images/fig-vary-with-power"><description>graphs of three variation with power</description></image></sidebyside>

<warning><p>The graph of a direct variation always passes through the origin, so when the input is zero, the output is also zero. Thus, the functions <m>~y = 3x + 2~</m> and <m>~y = 0.4x^2 - 2.3~</m>, for example, are not direct variation, even though they are increasing functions for positive <m>x</m>.</p></warning>

<subsection><title>Scaling</title>

<p>If <m>y</m> varies directly with <m>x</m>, then doubling <m>x</m> causes <m>y</m> to double also. But what if <m>y</m> varies directly with a <em>power</em> of <m>x</m> :<ul>
    <li> Is the area of a <m>16</m>-inch circular pizza double the area of an <m>8</m>-inch pizza?</li> 
    <li>If you double the dimensions of a model of a skyscraper, will its weight double also? </li> 
    </ul> </p>

<p>You probably know that the answer to both of these questions is <em>No</em>. The area of a circle is proportional to the <em>square</em> of its radius, and the volume (and hence the weight) of an object is proportional to the <em>cube</em> of its linear dimension. Variation with a power of <m>x</m> produces a different scaling effect.</p>

<example xml:id="example-scaling-weight"><statement><p>The Taipei 101 building is 1671 feet tall, and in 2006 it was the tallest skyscraper in the world. Show that doubling the dimensions of a model of the Taipei 101 building produces a model that weighs 8 times as much.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The Taipei 101 skyscraper is approximately box shaped, so its volume is given by the product of its linear dimensions, <m>V = lwh</m>. The weight of an object is proportional to its volume, so the weight, <m>W</m>, of the model is
    <me>W = klwh</me>
where the constant <m>k</m> depends on the material of the model. If we double the length, width, and height of the model, then
    <md><mrow> W_\text{new} \amp = k(2l)(2w)(2h)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = 2^3(klwh) = 8W_\text{old}</mrow>
    </md>
The weight of the new model is <m>2^3 = 8</m> times the weight of the original model.</p></solution></example>

<p>In general, if <m>y</m> varies directly with a power of <m>x</m>, that is, if <m>y = kx^n</m>, then doubling the value of <m>x</m> causes <m>y</m> to increase by a factor of <m>2^n</m>. In fact, if we multiply <m>x</m> by any positive number <m>c</m>, then  
        <md><mrow>y_\text{new} \amp =k(cx)^n</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =c^n(kx^n) = c^n(y_\text{old})</mrow></md>
so the value of <m>y</m> is multiplied by <m>c^n</m>.</p> 
    
<p>We will call <m>n</m> the <term>scaling exponent</term><idx>scaling exponent</idx>, and you will often see variation described in terms of scaling. For example, we might say that "the area of a circle scales as the square of its radius." (In many applications, the power <m>n</m> is called the <em>scale factor</em>, even though it is not a factor but an exponent.)</p>
